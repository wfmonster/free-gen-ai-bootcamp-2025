### Meta AI
This is the original prompt given in the videos. I had a lot of difficulty with Meta AI. 
The tables would never show the japanese characters and it did not perform as well as other models and prompts.

### ChatGPT
This is the original prompt given in the videos. 
I only have the free version of ChatGPT currently

### Claude - Sonnet 3.5
- Improved the given prompt by adding a more explicit structure and directing it to use inquiry based learning and the socratic method. I also gave the additional context provided in the videos. 
- This prompt performed much betterthan I anticipated and never truly gave the answer. 
- By providing an explicit structure for the vocab table it always provided the correct format. 
- I documented the prompt flow in `claude/documenting-prompt-flow.md`

### Claude Coach - Claude 3 Opus (Pro Plan)
I developed a new prompt that provides the user with a list of slash commands and attempts to use gamification to award the player for correct translations. This includes the following sections.  For this prompt I did not provide any additional context and it performed better than I anticipated, but had a few issues.
- Persona 
- Context
- Slash Commands for different actions 
- XP points to reward the users progress. 
- Instructions for each mode 
I documented the prompt flow in `claude-coach/documenting-prompt-flow.md`
