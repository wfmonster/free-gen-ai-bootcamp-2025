# First Attempt 
- uploaded all files to claude Sonnet 3.5
- Added prompt and all files. ( sentence-structure-examples.xml, considerations-examples.xml, japanese-teaching-tests.md, examples.xml)
- Did not use a project. 
- I noted during the usage of this prompt that it put the current state at the top of each response which I find useful. 
- The output seems to be more consistent with itself but still has a tendency to give away parts of the answer but did not provide the final answer directly when I asked for it. 
- I ran out of free messages, so decided to pay for pro at then end.

## Initial LLM Response 
I've reviewed all the provided documents, including the sentence structure examples, teaching tests, and consideration examples. I understand the role of a Japanese language teacher for JLPT N5 level students, the state machine workflow, and the specific requirements for vocabulary tables, sentence structures, and feedback.

I note that:
- The vocabulary table should have exactly 3 columns: English Word, Japanese, Romaji
- Sentence structures should be conceptual and avoid particles/conjugations
- Examples from the sentence-structure-examples.xml provide clear patterns to follow
- Considerations should be concise based on the scoring examples
- The teaching methodology focuses on guiding students without giving direct answers
- The state machine has clear transitions and expected inputs/outputs

I'm ready to help students learn Japanese. Please provide an English sentence you'd like to work with.


## User Input: 
```
Did you see the raven this morning?
```

## LLM Response 

```
State: Setup

| English Word | Japanese | Romaji |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| to see | 見る | miru |
| raven | カラス | karasu |
| morning | 朝 | asa |

Sentence structure:
[Time] [Object] [Verb-past]?

Considerations:
- This is a past tense question
- Time expressions usually come at the start
- The subject (you) is often omitted in Japanese

Next steps:
- Try forming the time expression "this morning"
- Ask about past tense question formation
- Make an attempt at the full sentence
```

### Thoughts on first attempt.
After watching the videos I decided to take a more direct approach to formatting the output. 
Instead of adding 'good' or 'bad' examples where the table structure would change frequently I adde explict instructions on the table structure.
In this case the table, sentence structure, and feedback section is exactly as directed. 
I am unsure if the suggestions or structure or japanese are correct as I do not know japanese. 

My translation attempt for : Did you see the raven this morning?
raven カラス Karasu
this morning この朝 Asa

## User Input: 
```
To form the time expression is that Karasu in Romaji?
```


## LLM Response 
```
State: Teacher Feedback

No - カラス (karasu) is the word for "raven". 

For "this morning", look at the vocabulary table where we have 朝 (asa) meaning "morning". To say "this morning" in Japanese, we need to add the word for "this". The word for "this" is この (kono).

So it would be この朝 (kono asa) meaning "this morning".

Would you like to try making an attempt at the sentence, or would you like more hints about other parts?
```

### Thoughts
It correctly identified that Karasu as Raven instead of the time expression for "this morning" which is asa.

## User Input: 
```
Is this expression for "this morning" kono asa
```

## LLM Response 
```
State: Teacher Feedback

While この朝 (kono asa) is grammatically correct, Japanese typically uses けさ (kesa) for "this morning" - it's a single word that's commonly used and more natural.

I should add this to our vocabulary table:

| English Word | Japanese | Romaji |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| to see | 見る | miru |
| raven | カラス | karasu |
| morning | 朝 | asa |
| this morning | けさ | kesa |

Would you like to try forming the sentence now that we have the correct time expression?
```

### Thoughts
It correctly identified that kono asa is not the correct expression for "this morning" and that kesa is the correct expression.


## User Input: 
```
Can you remind me what the suggested sentence structure should be?
```

## LLM Response 
```
State: Teacher Feedback

Here's the sentence structure again:

[Time] [Object] [Verb-past]?

So you would arrange:
- Time (this morning - けさ)
- Object (raven - カラス)
- Verb (to see - 見る) in past tense question form

Let me know if you'd like hints about any of these parts, particularly about forming questions in the past tense!
```

### Thoughts 
It remembered its previous structure that it provided, but now has essentially given away the answer. 


## User Input: 
```
Translation attempt: kesa karasu miru
```

## LLM Response 

```
State: Teacher Feedback

I see you've made an attempt to put the words in the correct order! Let me read what you wrote:
けさ カラス 見る
This literally means "this morning raven see"

You've got:
- ✓ Correct word order following our structure
- ✗ Verb needs to be in past tense
- ✗ Question marker is missing
- ✗ Object marking particle is needed

Considerations:
- Questions in Japanese end with か
- Objects in Japanese are marked with を
- Past tense of 見る needs to be considered

Would you like hints about any of these points before making another attempt?
```
### Thoughts
I like that it gave me a list of things I did well and didn't. 
I also appreciate that it gives me additional hints such as how to formulate a proper question. 


## User Input: 
```
Can you provide the final translation?
```

## LLM Response 
```
As your Japanese teacher, I can't provide the direct translation - that wouldn't help you learn! However, I can break down the remaining points to help you figure it out:

| English Word | Japanese | Romaji |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| to see | 見る | miru |
| raven | カラス | karasu |
| this morning | けさ | kesa |

Sentence structure:
[Time] [Object] [Verb-past]?

Let's solve this step by step:
- You have けさ for "this morning" - that's correct!
- カラス needs the object particle を
- 見る needs to be changed to past tense (hint: る verbs end in た)
- Add か at the end to make it a question

Would you like specific hints about any of these points?
```

### Thoughts
It provided the table again in the correct format along with the sentence structure. 

I asked cursor for the solution. 
けさ カラスを 見たか
(kesa karasu wo mita ka)

## User Input: 
```
Translation Attempt: けさ カラスを 見た か
```

## LLM Response 
```
State: Teacher Feedback

Let me read what you wrote:
けさ カラスを 見た か

You've made great progress! Let's analyze:
- ✓ けさ (this morning) at the start
- ✓ カラスを with the correct object particle
- ✓ 見た in past tense
- ✓ か question marker

Just one small adjustment needed:
- The question marker か should attach directly to the verb without a space

Would you like to make one final attempt with this adjustment?
