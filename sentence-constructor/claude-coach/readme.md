### Custom Japanse Language Coach 
I wanted to try to use a gamified approach that provides the following:
- Persona 
- Context
- Slash Commands for different actions 
- XP points to reward the users progress. 

### Intial Attempt
I developed a new prompt that is a gameified version of the previous claude prompt with different modes and xp points. 
I am attempting to provide only the prompt without additional context files first.
The prompt worked very well without additonal context files.
Formatting for the the tables and sentence structure looked correct. 
In the end it did give me the solution when I asked it for it and it currently does not correctly award XP points and instead awarded 10 points to the user when they asked for the translation. 

I would like to experiment more with the different styles such as 'concise' but I keep running out of messages which reset every 5 hours.
