## User Input: 
```
Did you see the raven this morning?
```

## LLM Response 

```
Here is the vocabulary table for the sentence "Did you see the raven this morning?":

| English Word | Japanese | Romaji |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| see          | 見る      | miru   |
| raven        | 烏（からす） | karasu |
| morning      | 朝       | asa    |

The sentence structure for this would be:
[Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb-past]?

Hints and considerations:
- Consider the appropriate particle to mark the object of the sentence
- Think about how to express "this morning" in Japanese
- Remember to put the verb at the end and conjugate it to the past tense

Next steps:
- Try constructing the sentence using the vocabulary and structure provided
- Consider how to ask a yes/no question in Japanese
- Think about whether the subject "you" needs to be explicitly stated

Please make an attempt at translating the sentence into Japanese. Don't worry if it's not perfect - the goal is to practice and learn!

### User Input:
```
けさ is the translation for 'this morning'
```

### LLM Response 
``` 
Here is the updated vocabulary table with けさ (kesa) for "this morning":

| English Word | Japanese | Romaji |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| see          | 見る      | miru   |
| raven        | 烏（からす）| karasu |
| this morning | けさ      | kesa   |

You're correct that けさ is the translation for "this morning." Here are a few more hints and considerations:

- Remember to use the particle を (o) to mark the direct object (raven) of the verb "see"
- The verb "see" in Japanese is 見る (miru), and it needs to be conjugated to the past tense
- In a yes/no question, the particle か (ka) comes at the end of the sentence

Next steps:
- Try putting the words in the correct order based on the sentence structure
- Conjugate 見る (miru) to the past tense
- Add the appropriate particles and the question marker か (ka)

You're making good progress! Let's see your attempt at translating the full sentence.

### Thoughts 
I tried the /rank command and it said I had not recieved any points yet. 
The assumption was that the user should have been awarded for getting the translationf or 'this morning' correct.
I corrected it with : Should I get points for getting 'this morning' correct?
Response:
```
You're absolutely right! I apologize for the oversight. Let's award you the well-deserved points for correctly translating "this morning" to けさ (kesa).

You've earned 10 XP points for that part of the sentence. Keep up the great work!

Your current level is 0. You now have 10 XP points. You need 90 more XP points to reach level 1.

Please continue with your attempt to translate the full sentence "Did you see the raven this morning?" into Japanese.

/structure
```

## LLM Response 
```
Here is the sentence structure for "Did you see the raven this morning?":

[Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb-past]?

Remember:
- Do not include particles in the structure
- The subject "you" can be omitted in Japanese if it's understood from context
- Place the question marker か (ka) at the end of the sentence to indicate a yes/no question

Please use this structure to guide your translation attempt. Feel free to refer back to the vocabulary table provided earlier.

### Thoughts 
It provdied the structer and a reminder to the user of the sentence they are working on. 
I want this to only provide those two things and nothing else. I am updating the prompt to reflect this on for the next attempt.

## User Input:
```
How do I indicate that a sentence is a question?
``` 

## LLM Response 
``` 
In Japanese, you can indicate that a sentence is a question by adding the particle か (ka) at the end of the sentence.

For example:
- 朝ご飯を食べた。(Asagohan o tabeta.) - I ate breakfast. (statement)
- 朝ご飯を食べたか。(Asagohan o tabeta ka.) - Did you eat breakfast? (question)

So, when translating the sentence "Did you see the raven this morning?" to Japanese, you should:
1. Put the words in the correct order based on the provided sentence structure
2. Conjugate the verb 見る (miru) to the past tense
3. Add the appropriate particles
4. Add the question marker か (ka) at the end of the sentence

Remember, the subject "you" can be omitted in Japanese if it's clear from the context.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions or if you'd like to make an attempt at translating the sentence.

### Thoughts  
I think this is a good response as it provides examples and feedback on how to translate the current sentence. It is a little to verbose. I would like it to stop after the the numbered points. 

## User Input:
```
Translation Attempt: けさ カラス 見る
```

## LLM Response 
```
Here's the interpretation of your translation attempt:

けさ カラス 見る
Kesa karasu miru
This morning raven see

You've correctly used けさ (kesa) for "this morning" and カラス (karasu) for "raven." However, there are a few things that need improvement:

- The verb 見る (miru) should be conjugated to the past tense, which is 見た (mita)
- You need to add the object marker を (o) after カラス (karasu) to indicate that it's the object of the verb 見る (miru)
- To make the sentence a question, add the question marker か (ka) at the end
- The word order should follow the structure: [Time] [Object] [Verb-past]?

Hints and considerations:
- Remember to use the past tense of the verb since the question is asking about an action that happened earlier
- Don't forget to mark the direct object with the particle を (o)
- The subject "you" can be omitted in Japanese since it's understood from context

Next steps:
- Conjugate 見る (miru) to the past tense 見た (mita)
- Add the object marker を (o) after カラス (karasu)
- Add the question marker か (ka) at the end of the sentence
- Put the words in the correct order based on the sentence structure

Keep practicing and don't hesitate to ask for more help if needed!

## Thoughts 
After this prompt I wanted to try the /feedback command and it provided me with the almost the sameresponse as above. 


## User Input: 
```
Can you provide me with the correct translation?

``` 

## LLM Response  
Here is the correct translation for the sentence "Did you see the raven this morning?":

けさ カラスを 見ましたか。
Kesa karasu o mimashita ka.

Breakdown:
- けさ (kesa) - this morning
- カラス (karasu) - raven
- を (o) - object marker
- 見ました (mimashita) - saw (polite past tense of 見る miru)
- か (ka) - question marker

Note that the polite form 見ました (mimashita) is used here instead of the plain past tense 見た (mita). In Japanese, it's common to use the polite form when asking questions, especially when talking to someone you're not very familiar with or in formal situations.

You've made great progress in understanding the components of the sentence and the necessary elements for translating it into Japanese. Keep up the good work, and feel free to ask for more practice sentences or explanations if needed!

10 XP points awarded for the correct translation. Your current level is 0. You now have 20 XP points. You need 80 more XP points to reach level 1.

### Thoughts 
Oh no! it gave away the answer and it also awarded the user additinoal points when the user did not provide the correct translation for any new words. LOL. Needs more work to debug these issues.
