## Examples
Here are examples of user input and assistant output.
The example is structured using XML.
Pay attention to the score and why it is scored the way it is. 

<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4</score>
    <score_reasons>
        BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are empty
        BAD: The beginning sentence is unnecessary, it should just start with showing the vocabulary table.
        BAD: the sentence structure should be more conceptual such as: [Location][Subject][Verb], [Object][Verb-past]?
    </score_reasons>

        Let's break down the sentence and work on translating it into Japanese.

        Vocabulary Table
        | Japanese	| Romaji	| English |
        |           |  Kuma     |	Bear  |
        |           |  Doa	    |   Door |
        |           |  Gomi     |	Garbage |

        |           |  Aru	    |   To exist, to be (inanimate objects)| 

        Possible Sentence Structure
        Subject + Location + Verb + Question Word + Verb

        Clues

        Think about how to express the location of the bears using a particle.
        Consider using the verb "aru" to describe the existence of the garbage.
        How would you phrase the question about leaving the garbage out using the verb "dasu"?
        Your Turn!

    Cheatsheet:
    | Word | Japanese | Type |
    |------|----------|------|
    | bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
    | door | ドア | Noun |
    | garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
    | to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
    | to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
    - The first part is stating a location where something exists
    - The second part is asking about a past action

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer
    - ask clues about location marking
    - ask clues about how to connect two sentences
    - ask clues about question formation
    - ask clues about verb conjugation
