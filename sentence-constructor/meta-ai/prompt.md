        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>4<score>
    <score_reasons>
        BAD: in the vocabulary table it did not show the japanese characters, the cells are empty
        BAD: The beginning sentence is unnecessary, it should just start with showing the vocabulary table.
        BAD: the sentence structure should be more conceptual such as: [Location][Subject][Verb], [Object][Verb-past]?

        Let's break down the sentence and work on translating it into Japanese.

        Vocabulary Table
        | Japanese	| Romaji	| English |
        |           |  Kuma     |	Bear  |
        |           |  Doa	    |   Door |
        |           |  Gomi     |	Garbage |

        |           |  Aru	    |   To exist, to be (inanimate objects)| 

        Possible Sentence Structure
        Subject + Location + Verb + Question Word + Verb

        Clues

        Think about how to express the location of the bears using a particle.
        Consider using the verb "aru" to describe the existence of the garbage.
        How would you phrase the question about leaving the garbage out using the verb "dasu"?
